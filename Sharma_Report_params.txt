--Project_Title "PEG-Hydrogel vs In vitro / In vivo Samples"
--Study_Summary "To compare the gene expression profile of our in vitro PEG-based tumor model to traditional tumor models of increasing complexity (2D and subcutaneous)"
--Sample_Types "Human lung cancer cells (A549 Luciferase expressing cells), 2D cell culture, 3D PEG-based tumor, subcutaneous xenograft, orthotopic xenograft. "
--Organism "Human (the immortalized cell line is derived from a 58-year-old white male; purchased from ATCC)"
--Analysis_Goals "This analysis is a follow-up to a previous analysis. For this analysis, "We want to benchmark our PEG-based hydrogel tumor model against traditional in vitro and in vivo models. Therefore, we want to compare the gene expression profile of the PEG based tumor model against *in vivo* subcutaneous tumor (control) and 2D cell culture, and additional compare 2D cell culture against *in vivo* subcutaneous tumor (control).
